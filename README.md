# Sentiment Analysis on Twitter Data
## Project Overview
This project performs sentiment analysis on Twitter data related to a specific topic (e.g., "Borderlands"). The goal is to analyze the sentiment of tweets (positive, negative, or neutral) and visualize the results.
## Technologies Used

Python: Primary programming language.

Libraries:

pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.

nltk: Natural Language Toolkit for text preprocessing.

textblob/vaderSentiment: Sentiment analysis.

matplotlib/seaborn: Data visualization.

wordcloud: Word cloud generation.

Jupyter Notebook: Interactive development environment.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains Twitter data with the following columns:

Tweettext: The text of the tweet.

Cleanedtext: Preprocessed text after cleaning and tokenization.

Sentiment: Sentiment score (ranging from -1 to 1).

SentimentCategory: Categorized sentiment (Positive, Negative, Neutral).

## Steps Performed
### Data Loading:

Loaded the dataset from a CSV file.

### Data Preprocessing:

Removed special characters, converted text to lowercase, and tokenized the text.

Removed stopwords and performed optional lemmatization.

### Sentiment Analysis:

Used VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) to calculate sentiment scores.

Categorized sentiment into Positive, Negative, and Neutral.

### Visualization:

Plotted the distribution of sentiment categories.

Generated word clouds for positive and negative tweets.

### Saving Results:

Saved the processed dataset with sentiment analysis results to a CSV file.

## How to Run the Project
### Install Dependencies:
Ensure you have the required libraries installed. Run the following command:
pip install pandas nltk textblob vaderSentiment matplotlib seaborn wordcloud

## Download NLTK Resources:
Download the necessary NLTK resources by running the following code in a Python environment:
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('stopwords')

# Results
## Sentiment Distribution:

A bar plot showing the distribution of Positive, Negative, and Neutral tweets.

## Word Clouds:

Visualizations of the most frequent words in positive and negative tweets.

## Processed Dataset:

A CSV file containing the cleaned text, sentiment scores, and sentiment categories.

# Future Enhancements
## Advanced Models:

Use machine learning models (e.g., BERT, LSTM) for more accurate sentiment analysis.

## Real-Time Analysis:

Perform real-time sentiment analysis on live Twitter data using the Twitter API.

## Multilingual Support:

Extend the project to handle tweets in multiple languages.
